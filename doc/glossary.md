# Glossary


- **bundle:** A collection of axons that run together but do not necessarily have the same origin and destination (Bear
  et al., 2016).
- **nerve:** A bundle of axons in the peripheral nervous system (Bear et al., 2016).
- **phantom** A computational model of the human body (Xu & Eckerman, 2009). In the context of this project, a "phantom"
  refers to a "brain phantom", which in turn refers to a "brain white matter phantom". The phrase "white matter phantom"
  can also be used for the same meaning.
- **tract:** A collection of central nervous system axons with a common site of origin and a common destination (Bear et
  al., 2016).
- **white matter:** A generic term for a collection of central nervous system axons. When a freshly dissected brain is
  cut open, axons appear white (Bear et al., 2016).
