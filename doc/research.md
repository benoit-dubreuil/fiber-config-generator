## Phantom generator

In
the [final report](https://github.com/linum-uqam/inf6200-h2022-benoit-dubreuil/blob/main/report/2022_inf6200_benoit_dubreuil.pdf)
of the initation to research course back in the winter 2022 term that preceeded this internship,
the [Simulation Generator](https://github.com/AlexVCaron/voxsim) Python library was singled out as the software that
suited our needs of automation capability, ergonomics, functional independence and being coded in Python. Since then,
our requirements have become stricter and more specific to the fields of tractography and biomedical microscopy.
Thenceforth, in order to delegate the white matter phantom generation to an external library, it is imperative that it
parameterizes and allows its users to control the axon distribution, neural morphology and biological neural network.
