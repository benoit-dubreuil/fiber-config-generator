## Simulation Generator, voXSim and Fiberfox

voXSim is an amelioration of Fiberfox which, contrarily to the latter, allows its users to control the white matter
bundle generation through the command-line interface (CLI). Also, Simulation Generator offers a high level Python API to
voXSim. There are no equivalents for Fiberfox.

voXSim and Simulation Generator are both developed by Alex Valcourt Caron from the Sherbrooke Connectivity Imaging
Laboratory ([SCIL](https://scil.dinf.usherbrooke.ca/)).
