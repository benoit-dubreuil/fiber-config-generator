## VoxSim parameters

Unimportant or irrelevant VoxSim parameters are defined as constants and thus have no value in being parameterized for
this application. Also, Simulation Generator offers a lot of flexibility with a multitude of parameters, many of which
are interconnected. In order to reduce the noise and focus on more abstract concepts, some of Simulation Generator's
general parameters are defined as conventions (constants).
